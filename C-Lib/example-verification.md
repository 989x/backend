### Ask

We are making a wallet api.
Need a verification system to ensure the safety of the api system.

You can create anything. I'll look at it as a guideline.
But the jwt system, we'll do it later. I'd like to see some other middleware.

Certainly, adding a verification system to enhance the security of your API is an important step. One way to improve security is by implementing middleware that can help with request validation, authentication, and authorization. Here are some middleware components you can consider:

1.`Request Logging Middleware:` This middleware can log incoming requests, which can be valuable for auditing and debugging. You can log request information such as the HTTP method, URL, user agent, and timestamp.

```ts
// Create a request logging middleware
export const requestLogger = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  console.log(`[${timestamp}] ${req.method} ${req.url} - ${req.get('user-agent')}`);
  next();
};
```

To use this middleware, add it to your Express application before your route handlers:

```ts
app.use(requestLogger);
```

2.`Authentication Middleware:` Authentication middleware can help protect your API by ensuring that incoming requests are made by authenticated users. You can create a middleware function that verifies a user's identity before allowing access to protected routes. However, you mentioned that you'll implement JWT later, so I'll provide a basic example:

```ts
// Authentication middleware (basic example)
export const authenticate = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  // Check if the user is authenticated (e.g., using JWT)
  const isAuthenticated = /* Your authentication logic here */;
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    next(); // Allow access to the route
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
};
```

You can use the `authenticate` middleware to protect specific routes by adding it as middleware to those routes.

3.`Authorization Middleware:` Authorization middleware can be used to control what authenticated users are allowed to do. For example, you can restrict certain actions to specific user roles or permissions. Here's a basic example:

```ts
// Authorization middleware (basic example)
export const authorize = (role: string) => {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // Check if the user has the required role
    const userRole = /* Get the user's role from authentication */;
    if (userRole === role) {
      next(); // Allow access to the route
    } else {
      res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
    }
  };
};
```

You can use the `authorize` middleware to specify the required role when protecting specific routes.

4.`Validation Middleware:` Request validation middleware can help ensure that incoming data meets certain criteria. For example, you can use the express-validator library to validate and sanitize input data.

```ts
import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator';

// Validation middleware example
const validateRequest = [
  body('email').isEmail(),
  body('password').isLength({ min: 6 }),
  (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    next();
  },
];
```

You can use `validateRequest` as middleware for specific routes that need request data validation.

These are some basic middleware components you can use to enhance the security and functionality of your wallet API. Depending on your application's specific needs, you can expand and customize these middleware functions further. When you're ready to implement JWT authentication, you can replace the basic authenticate middleware with a more robust JWT authentication system.
