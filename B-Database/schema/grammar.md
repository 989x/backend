## Ask

I want to add this section to estateSchema,
Which one should I use? Please advise.

```js
saves: string[];
saveds: string[];
```

Choose just one because it will be used instead of favorited
Because it's a long word.

If you want to add a section to the `estateSchema` to indicate that users have saved or favorited an estate listing, you can choose either `saves` or `saveds` based on your preference. Both options can be used effectively, but I'll provide some considerations for each choice:

### Option 1: `saves`

```js
saves: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }]
```

In this option, you use a plural form "saves," which implies that each estate listing can have multiple users who have saved it. This is a straightforward and descriptive choice.

### Option 2: `saveds`

```js
saveds: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }]
```

In this option, you use a plural form "saveds," which is also clear and descriptive. It follows the convention of making the attribute name sound more like a noun.

Both options are valid and can work effectively. The choice between them primarily comes down to your personal preference and the naming conventions you prefer to follow in your application. You should choose the one that you find more intuitive and readable in the context of your codebase.

For example, if you prefer using singular nouns for attribute names (e.g., `user` instead of `users`), you might opt for `saves`. On the other hand, if you prefer plural nouns for collections (e.g., `estates` instead of `estate`), you might choose `saveds`.

Here's how the attribute might look in your `estateSchema`:

```js
saves: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }]
```

You can then use this attribute to associate users who have saved or favorited a particular estate listing.

use mongodb, What name should I use in this code?
Choose only one that is appropriate for your grammar. The most English

between
```js
saves: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[];
saveds: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[];
```

to replace
```js
favorites: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Estate" }],

interface IUser {
  acc: {
    ...
  };
  info: {
    ...
  };
  estates: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[];
  favorites: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[];
}
```

## ChatGPT

To replace `favorites: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Estate" }],` in the `IUser` interface with a more appropriate name, you can use either `saves` or `saveds`. Both are grammatically correct, but the choice depends on your preference for pluralization:

1. `saves`:
```js
saves: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[];
```

2. `saveds`:
```js
saveds: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[];
```

Both options are valid and would work in your code. You can choose the one that fits your naming conventions and coding style the best.
