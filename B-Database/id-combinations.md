Right now I'm working on a system to generate IDs with a database.
Set x to be the numbers 0-9 and the letters a-z.

I would like to ask about the possibility that the letters xxxx will be duplicates. 
I would like to know how many data can be used with this format of id.

Please summarize in the case that x has 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 characters,
and show examples of the values of the variable x in each case that can occur.

Sure, here's a summary of the number of possible unique combinations and some examples for different lengths of the variable 'x' in your ID format, where each 'x' can be any digit from 0 to 9 or any lowercase letter from a to z:

1. For 'x' with `4 characters`:
- Number of combinations = `1,679,616`
- Examples of 'x': `1234`, `wxyz`, `a1c3`

2. For 'x' with `6 characters`:
- Number of combinations = `2,176,782,336`
- Examples of 'x': `abc123`, `x8k9h2`, `4x1y6z`

3. For 'x' with `8 characters`: 
- Number of combinations = `2,821,109,907,456`
- Examples of 'x': `q1w2e3r4`, `7y8z9x0`, `aabbccdd`

4. For 'x' with `10 characters`:
- Number of combinations = `1,162,261,467,810,945,600`
- Examples of 'x': `0123456789`, `xyz123abc4`, `9a1b2c3d4e`

5. For 'x' with `12 characters`:
- Number of combinations = `4,738,381,338,321,616,896,256`
- Examples of 'x': `abcdef123456`, `1a2b3c4d5e6f`, `zyxw98765432`

As you can see, as the length of 'x' increases, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially, leading to a much larger space of unique IDs. However, it's essential to have a robust system in place to ensure the uniqueness of these IDs during generation and use.
