### Ask

I would like to ask about the design of the system. 
Transactions will be a database that does not need to be linked to other databases, right? 
Just asking to be sure.

The decision of whether to link the `Transaction` database to other databases depends on your specific use case and design preferences. Here are a few considerations:

1. `Isolation and Independence:`
- If you want the Transaction database to be independent and not directly linked to other databases, it could make sense in scenarios where transactions are a standalone entity.
- This can provide a level of isolation, making it easier to manage and maintain.

2. `Performance and Scalability:`
- Separating the Transaction database might help with performance and scalability. If the transaction volume is high, having a dedicated database can optimize queries related to transactions.

3. `Data Integrity:`
- On the other hand, if transactions are closely related to other entities (e.g., users, wallets, coins), you might consider linking them directly to maintain data integrity and consistency.

4. `Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) Properties:`
- If your application requires strict adherence to ACID properties, you might need to ensure that transactions and related entities are treated atomically and consistently.

5. `Reporting and Analytics:`
- Consider how you plan to query and analyze transaction data. If you often need to join transaction data with other entities, having them in separate databases may introduce complexity.

6. `Application Requirements:`
- The architecture should align with your application's requirements and use cases. If transactions are a critical part of your application and need special handling, a dedicated database might be beneficial.

In summary, there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on the specifics of your application and how you plan to interact with and manage transaction data. Both approaches (linked and independent databases) can be valid based on your use case and design preferences.
