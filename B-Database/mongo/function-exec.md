## Ask

I would like to ask, in the estate and auth files, some code functions are different.

```ts
const existingUserID = await User.findOne({ 'acc.userID': userID });
const existingEstateID = await Estate.findOne({ "head.estateID": estateID }).exec();
```

.exec() Is it very necessary? Or will it make the work very different?

The `.exec()` method in Mongoose is optional in many cases, and whether or not to use it depends on the specific situation.

In Mongoose, queries are not executed until you explicitly call `exec()` or use `await`. The purpose of `exec()` is to execute the query and return a promise. When you use `await` with a Mongoose query, it implicitly calls `exec()`.

So, for example, these two statements are equivalent:

```ts
const existingUserID = await User.findOne({ 'acc.userID': userID }).exec();
```

and

```ts
const existingUserID = await User.findOne({ 'acc.userID': userID });
```

Both will return a promise that resolves to the result of the query.

However, there are some scenarios where using `exec()` might be necessary or beneficial:

### 1. When chaining queries: 

If you're chaining multiple queries or functions, using `exec()` can make the code more readable.

```ts
const result = await User.findOne({ 'acc.userID': userID })
  .populate('someField')
  .exec();
```

### 2. When using callbacks:

If you're working with callbacks instead of promises, you would use `exec()` to execute the query and handle the result in a callback.

```ts
User.findOne({ 'acc.userID': userID }).exec((err, user) => {
  // Handle result or error here
});
```

### 3. When returning the query object: 

If you want to return the query object for some reason, you might use `exec()`.

```ts
const query = User.findOne({ 'acc.userID': userID });
// Do something with the query...
const result = await query.exec();
```

In your specific case, using `.exec()` is not strictly necessary for simple queries, and removing it would not make a significant difference. The choice between using it or not often comes down to personal preference and coding style.
