The error you're encountering, "TypeError: res.status is not a function," typically occurs when the `res` object passed to your function is not recognized as an instance of the Express `Response` object. This could happen if you haven't properly imported and used Express in your TypeScript file.

Here's how you can modify your code to ensure that the `Response` object is correctly recognized:

### 1. Ensure you've imported the necessary dependencies at the top of your TypeScript file:

```ts
import { Response } from 'express';
import Blog from './models/Blog'; // Import your Blog model here
```

Make sure to replace `'./models/Blog'` with the correct path to your Blog model.

### 1. Update your function to include the `Request` object and route handler signature:

```ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const limitBlog = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const blogs = await Blog.find()
      .populate('user')
      .select('-__v')
      .limit(4); 
    res.status(200).json({ blogs });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error });
  }
};
```

By including `req: Request` in the function parameters, you make sure that both the `Request` and `Response` objects are recognized correctly as Express objects.

Additionally, ensure that you have properly configured and set up your Express server, including middleware, routes, and any required dependencies like Mongoose (for MongoDB).

If you continue to face issues, please make sure that your project structure and dependencies are correctly set up and that you are using the appropriate versions of Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript.
