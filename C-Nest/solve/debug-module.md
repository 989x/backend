### Nestjs Error: Cannot find module './app.controller'
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61306329/nestjs-error-cannot-find-module-app-controller

I cant seem to locate where the error is coming from as the app compiled with Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes. I have seen similar resolve on StackOverflow but none seem to address the issue

Run:
```bash
npm run prebuild
```
or
```bash
rimraf dist
```
or
```bash
rm -rf dist/
```
