### Response from ChatGPT

In your MongoDB document, you have two `_id` fields. The first one is an automatically generated MongoDB ObjectId:

```json
"_id": {
  "$oid": "64cd22b4fc8048b0d7dd8002"
},
```

This ObjectId is generated by MongoDB when you insert a document and is unique to each document in your collection.

The second one is within the `account` subdocument:

```json
"account": {
  "userID": "user-5m553oe002",
  // ...
}
```

Which `_id` you should use depends on your specific use case:

1. `Primary Document ID (_id at the top level):` If you want to uniquely identify the entire User document in your MongoDB collection, you should use the first `_id` (the one at the top level of the document). This is the default MongoDB document ID and is commonly used for identifying documents in a collection.
2. `User-specific Identifier (userID within account):` If you want to identify the user based on their `userID`, which appears to be a custom identifier for your application, you can use the `userID` field within the `account` subdocument. This could be useful if you want to quickly find a user by their custom user ID.

In most cases, when working with MongoDB and Mongoose, you would use the primary document `_id` as the unique identifier for retrieving and updating documents, as it's automatically indexed and efficiently queried by MongoDB. The `userID` field within the `account` subdocument is typically used for business logic within your application but may not be as efficient for direct document retrieval.
