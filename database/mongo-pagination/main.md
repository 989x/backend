use node express typescript
database use mongodb 

This is my code But there is a problem that my mongodb has thousands of data.
This makes one search take a very long time, can Limit and Pagination be used with this code?

...code before
<main.ts />

### ChatGPT

Yes, you can implement pagination in your code to improve the performance of searches with a large dataset. Pagination allows you to retrieve a subset of the results at a time, making it more manageable.

Here's how you can modify your code to include pagination:

page pageSize .skip .limit
<main.ts />

In this modified code:

- I added `page` and `pageSize` parameters to your query parameters. `page` specifies the page number, and `pageSize` specifies the number of items per page.
- I calculated the `skip` value based on the current page and page size. This value is then used in the `skip` function of the query to skip the appropriate number of documents before retrieving the next batch.

By incorporating pagination in your code, you can limit the number of results returned in a single request, making the response faster and more efficient. Clients can then request additional pages as needed. Adjust the `pageSize` according to your requirements.

### Ask

I'd like to make additional changes to the code. 
For the pageSize value, set it in express. 
When used, only the value page=2 will be used.

### ChatGPT

Sure, if you want to set a default `pageSize` in your Express server and only use the `page` parameter in the API, you can modify your code like this:

pageSize = 10;
<main.ts />

In this code:

- I set a default `pageSize` to 10, but if you want a different default, you can adjust the value accordingly.
- I removed the `pageSize` from the query parameters, and now the code always uses the default value.

With this setup, when your frontend makes a request like:

```
http://localhost:3000/properties?findStatus=rentPerDay&minBed=1&minBath=1&page=2
```

It will use the default `pageSize` (in this case, 10) for pagination. If you ever want to change the default `pageSize`, you can simply update the value in the code.

### Ask

I feel like there is a problem with Express not sending the totalRecords value to the frontend, causing the frontend to not know how many records there are in the page.

### ChatGPT

To handle pagination on the frontend, you need to ensure that the server (Express) sends information about the total number of records to the client. This information is crucial for the client to calculate the total number of pages and display an accurate pagination control.

Here's how you can modify your Express code to include the total number of records in the response:

1. Modify the `searchEstate` function in your Express code:

In your Express code, you need to modify the response to include not just the estates but also the total number of records. The response should look something like this:

totalRecords
<main.ts />

This code uses the `countDocuments` method to calculate the total number of records without applying pagination. The `totalRecords` value is then included in the response.
