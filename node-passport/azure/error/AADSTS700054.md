## Error Message

Hi, I registered a single-page application (SPA) in the Microsoft identity platform for MSAL v2. Firstly I tried on dev server and can access my web app via PC and mobile.

But then I registered a new SPA for QA server with same configuration as dev but I got error like below on mobile but I can access my web on PC.

## Solution

Based on the error, it looks like you are using the Implicit flow and the id_token is not enabled for the application.

To enable the ID_Token issuance for the application, you need to navigate to:

Azure AD > Application Registration > Search and open your application > Authentication > Under Implicit grant and hybrid flows section > select the checkbox for ID token as hightlighted
